## Bilingual Support

The product targets both Spanish and English audiences. Implementation status:
- Some models have `*_en` / `*_es` field pairs — coverage is **incomplete**
- Frontend i18n via `next-intl 4.8.2` is configured but **not yet activated** in most components
- New code should use `useTranslations()` from the start

---

## Tech Debt / Known Gaps

- `GalleryField` on `Project`, `Service`, `Post`, `HomePage`, `AboutPage` is declared but serializers do not yet uniformly expose gallery URLs
- Lead management is admin-only (no frontend lead management UI)
- Bilingual coverage is incomplete — many components still hardcode Spanish strings
- Frontend E2E profiles are limited to Desktop Chrome only
- The `build_to_django.sh` deployment script is referenced in docs but does not yet exist
