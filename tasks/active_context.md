## Current task

Upgrade the 17 Python packages reported as outdated on 2026-08-27. The work is
isolated in one PR, with one dependency per commit and a mandatory green CI run
between dependencies.

## Current step

redis 7.4.0 -> 8.1.0. Huey 3.3.4 passed an isolated requirements install,
`pip check`, Django's system check, schedule predicates, and all five project
task wrappers; all earlier commits are green in PR CI.

## Guardrails

- Never mutate the deploy clone's venv or production database.
- Resolve and test packages in an isolated temporary Python 3.12 venv.
- Django remains below 6.1 while the server uses MySQL 8.0.46.
- Do not proceed to the next dependency while PR CI is red or pending.
