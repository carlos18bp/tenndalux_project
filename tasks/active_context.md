## Current task

Upgrade the 17 Python packages reported as outdated on 2026-08-27. The work is
isolated in one PR, with one dependency per commit and a mandatory green CI run
between dependencies.

## Current step

idna 3.13 -> 3.19. urllib3 2.7.0 passed an isolated requirements install,
`pip check`, and a Requests adapter smoke check; all earlier commits are green
in PR CI.

## Guardrails

- Never mutate the deploy clone's venv or production database.
- Resolve and test packages in an isolated temporary Python 3.12 venv.
- Django remains below 6.1 while the server uses MySQL 8.0.46.
- Do not proceed to the next dependency while PR CI is red or pending.
