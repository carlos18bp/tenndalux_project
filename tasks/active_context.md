## Current task

Upgrade the 17 Python packages reported as outdated on 2026-08-27. The work is
isolated in one PR, with one dependency per commit and a mandatory green CI run
between dependencies.

## Current step

urllib3 2.6.3 -> 2.7.0. pip 26.2.1 passed an isolated requirements install
and `pip check`; PyJWT 2.13.0 is already green in PR CI.

## Guardrails

- Never mutate the deploy clone's venv or production database.
- Resolve and test packages in an isolated temporary Python 3.12 venv.
- Django remains below 6.1 while the server uses MySQL 8.0.46.
- Do not proceed to the next dependency while PR CI is red or pending.
